# AWS Scripts

### What this is 

Lately, I've been getting into working with AWS Lambda and AWS DynamoDB. I am working on a set of bash scripts employing the AWS CLI tools to make my life easier. 

### Functions
Lambdize: Create a new lambda function and return the arn:
```{bash}
./lambdize.sh app.js
```
